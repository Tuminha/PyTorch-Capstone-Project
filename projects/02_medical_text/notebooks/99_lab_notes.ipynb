    "\n",
    "**4. OOV Problem is Real**  \n",
    "- 48% of samples had unknown words in baseline vocab  \n",

    "### 💭 Personal Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Surprised Me Most:**  \n",
    "The magnitude of improvement from transfer learning! I expected BioBERT to be better, but **2.16x better** (116% relative improvement) was mind-blowing. The fact that 1 epoch of BioBERT (83.73%) crushed 12 epochs of baseline (63.01%) showed that pre-trained knowledge is irreplaceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardest Challenge:**  \n",
    "**CPU training BioBERT for 2.5 hours per epoch!** The \"32 minutes, 0 epochs\" moment was genuinely scary—I thought my code had crashed!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proudest Moment:**  \n",
    "When test results showed **BioBERT: 83.79% F1 (same as validation!)** while **baseline collapsed to 38.73%**. This validated my entire pipeline and proved this is **production-ready work!** 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Valuable Lesson:**  \n",
    "**\"Always test on held-out data.\"** Baseline looked okay at 63% validation F1, but test revealed the truth (39% F1). The discipline of proper train/val/test splits saved me from shipping a terrible model!\n",
