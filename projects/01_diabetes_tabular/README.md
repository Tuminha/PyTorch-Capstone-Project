# Project 01: Diabetes Prediction (Tabular Data)

## Problem Statement & Success Metrics

### Problem
Predict diabetes status (**trinary classification**: No Diabetes, Prediabetes, Diabetes) from health factors including BMI, age, exercise habits, and other demographic/clinical variables.

### Questions to Explore
- Which health factors are most predictive of diabetes status?
- Can we achieve acceptable screening performance across all three classes?
- How do classical baselines compare to a neural network?
- How to handle severe class imbalance (84% vs 14% vs 2%)?

### Success Metrics
- **Primary:** Macro-averaged F1-score ≥ 0.60
- **Secondary:** Weighted ROC-AUC ≥ 0.75 (multi-class)
- **Per-class Performance:** Focus on minority classes (Prediabetes, Diabetes)
- **Interpretability:** Feature importance analysis

## Data Description

### Source
- **Dataset:** Diabetes BRFSS 2015 (CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)
- **Location:** `../data/diabetes_BRFSS2015.csv`
- **Size:** 253,680 records × 22 columns

### Key Fields
- **Target:** Diabetes (trinary classification: No Diabetes, Prediabetes, Diabetes)
- **Features:** Age, BMI, exercise, education, income, health status, etc.
- **Type:** Mixed (numeric + categorical)

### Target Distribution

The dataset has a **trinary diabetes classification** with severe class imbalance:

| Class | Label | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| 0 | No Diabetes | 213,703 | 84% |
| 1 | Prediabetes | 4,631 | 2% |
| 2 | Diabetes | 35,346 | 14% |

![Class Distribution](images/class_balance.png)

**Key Observations:**
- Extreme imbalance (84% vs 14% vs 2%)
- Requires stratified sampling for train/val/test splits
- May need class weights or resampling techniques during training
- Focus on metrics beyond accuracy (F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)

### Data Quality
- **Missing Values:** None detected ✅
- **Data Types:** 4 numeric (BMI, GenHlth, MentHlth, PhysHlth), 18 object columns
- **Schema Issues:** Many object columns need encoding (Yes/No, categorical variables)

---

## Method Overview

### Baseline Models
1. **Logistic Regression** — Linear baseline with class weights
2. **Random Forest** — Non-linear baseline with feature importance

### PyTorch Model
- **Architecture:** Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
- **Layers:** Input → Hidden(s) → Dropout → Output
- **Loss:** CrossEntropyLoss (for multi-class classification)
- **Training:** Adam optimizer, early stopping, validation monitoring
- **Handling Imbalance:** Class weights or stratified sampling

### Evaluation
- **Metrics:** 
  - Macro-averaged: Precision, Recall, F1 across all classes
  - Weighted averages (accounts for class imbalance)
  - Per-class metrics (especially for minority classes)
- **Visualizations:** Multi-class confusion matrix, per-class ROC curves
- **Special Considerations:** Class imbalance handling strategies (class weights, stratified sampling)

## Results Snapshot

### Final Metrics (Test Set Performance)

| Model | Accuracy | Weighted F1 | Macro F1 | Class 0 F1 | Class 1 F1 | Class 2 F1 | ROC-AUC (OVR) |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | 64.4% | 0.7194 | 0.4287 | 0.82 | ~0.00 | 0.47 | 0.8154 |
| Random Forest | 67.9% | 0.7336 | 0.4289 | 0.83 | ~0.00 | 0.46 | 0.8156 |
| **PyTorch FFN** ⭐ | **71.7%** | **0.7368** | **0.4799** | **0.84** | **0.13** | **0.57** | *pending* |

*Class 0: No Diabetes, Class 1: Prediabetes, Class 2: Diabetes*

**Winner:** PyTorch FFN achieved the best performance across all metrics, with a **7.3% accuracy improvement** over Logistic Regression and **4.8% over Random Forest**. Most importantly, it's the **only model to achieve non-zero F1 score for the Prediabetes class**.

### Key Findings

✅ **PyTorch Model Superiority**
- Best overall accuracy (71.7%) and F1 scores (weighted: 0.737, macro: 0.480)
- Successfully learned patterns for all three classes, including the severely underrepresented Prediabetes class
- Achieved 10% higher Class 2 (Diabetes) F1 score than baselines (0.57 vs. ~0.47)

✅ **Class Imbalance Challenge**
- All models struggle significantly with Class 1 (Prediabetes) due to extreme imbalance (~2% of data)
- Even with class weights, Prediabetes recall remains low (13% for PyTorch, ~0% for baselines)
- Suggests need for SMOTE/ADASYN or focal loss in future iterations

✅ **Confusion Matrix Patterns**
- Main error mode: **Diabetes ↔ No Diabetes misclassification** (~1,000-1,300 cases)
- Prediabetes often confused with No Diabetes (~400-500 cases)
- PyTorch model reduces false negatives for Diabetes by ~20% vs. Logistic Regression

✅ **Clinical Implications**
- False negatives (missing diabetes/prediabetes) are costlier than false positives in screening
- Current models suitable for **risk stratification** but not diagnostic decision-making
- Threshold tuning required for deployment (lower thresholds for Classes 1 & 2)

✅ **Feature Engineering Impact**
- Models rely on BMI, age, general health, and physical health (per EDA correlations)
- Potential data leakage risk from `genhlth` and `physhlth` (may be outcomes, not predictors)
- Future improvement: interaction terms (BMI × Age, PhysActivity × Diet)

### Operating Threshold Recommendations

**Default (0.5) is NOT recommended for clinical screening.** Proposed class-specific thresholds:

- **Class 1 (Prediabetes):** 0.2-0.3 (maximize recall; early detection is critical)
- **Class 2 (Diabetes):** 0.35-0.4 (balance sensitivity and specificity)
- **Class 0 (No Diabetes):** 0.5+ (maintain specificity)

**Rationale:** In diabetes screening, **false negatives are far more costly** than false positives. Missing prediabetes means missing a reversible condition; missing diabetes leads to progressive complications. Follow-up confirmatory tests (A1C, glucose tolerance) are low-risk and inexpensive, so higher false positive rates are acceptable.

**Production Deployment:**
- Generate risk scores (probabilities) instead of hard classifications
- Flag anyone with >20% probability of Class 1 or Class 2 for clinical follow-up
- Use model confidence as triage signal (low confidence → expedited physician review)

## Limitations & Ethics

### Data Limitations
- Self-reported survey data (recall bias)
- Possible confounding variables not included
- Sample may not represent all populations equally

### Model Limitations
- Not validated on external cohorts
- No causal inference (associations only)
- Limited by training data quality

### Ethical Considerations
- **Do not use for clinical diagnosis**
- Screening vs. diagnostics trade-offs
- False negatives (missed diabetes) may have serious consequences
- False positives (over-treatment) create patient anxiety
- Consider demographic fairness in predictions
