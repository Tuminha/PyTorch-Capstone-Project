    "## üéØ Concept Primer\\n",
    "\\n",
    "In this capstone project, we're building a **portfolio-ready** diabetes prediction model using tabular health data. This project demonstrates the **full ML pipeline** from data loading through model evaluation.\\n",
    "\\n",
    "### Tabular ML Flow\\n",
    "1. **Define the problem** ‚Äî What are we predicting? What metrics matter?\\n",
    "2. **Load & inspect** ‚Äî Understand data structure, dtypes, missingness\\n",
    "3. **Clean** ‚Äî Handle missing values, outliers, rename columns\\n",
    "4. **Explore** ‚Äî Visualize distributions, correlations, class balance\\n",
    "5. **Preprocess** ‚Äî Encode categoricals, scale continuous, split train/val/test\\n",
    "6. **Baseline** ‚Äî Simple models to sanity-check data quality\\n",
    "7. **Build PyTorch model** ‚Äî Neural network for tabular data\\n",
    "8. **Evaluate** ‚Äî Honest out-of-sample metrics\\n",
    "\\n",
    "### Why Start with Goals?\\n",
    "Defining success upfront prevents scope creep and helps you know when you're done. Healthcare ML needs clear **operating context** ‚Äî are we screening (high recall) or diagnosing (high precision)?"
