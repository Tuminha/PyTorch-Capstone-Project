    "- Clear problem definition: Trinary classification (No Diabetes, Prediabetes, Diabetes)\n",
    "- Understanding that class imbalance would be a major challenge\n",
    "- Setting realistic success metrics (Macro F1 ≥ 0.60, ROC-AUC ≥ 0.75)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Decisions:**\n",
    "- Focus on macro-averaged metrics to account for class imbalance\n",
    "- Prioritize per-class performance, especially for minority classes\n",
    "- Plan for interpretability (feature importance analysis)\n",

    "- **84% No Diabetes, 14% Diabetes, 2% Prediabetes** - severe imbalance\n",
    "- No missing values (excellent data quality)\n",
    "- 18 object columns need encoding\n",

    "- BMI outliers (>60) are physiologically unrealistic → capped at 60\n",
    "- MentHlth and PhysHlth distributions (0-30 days) are naturally zero-inflated, not errors\n",

    "**Key Decisions:**\n",
    "- Kept categorical columns as objects (not converting to integers prematurely)\n",
    "- Capped BMI at 60 (575 cases affected)\n",
    "- Preserved MentHlth/PhysHlth distributions (zeros are valid \"no bad days\" responses)\n",
    "- GenHlth verified as valid 1-5 scale\n",

    "\n",
    "**Second Error:**\n",

    "#### Part 1: Building the `TabularFFN` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I Learned (Line-by-Line):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Definition:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class TabularFFN(nn.Module):\n",
    "       def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):\n",
    "           super().__init__()  # MUST call parent __init__\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Always inherit from `nn.Module`\n",
    "   - `super().__init__()` initializes PyTorch machinery\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Layers in `__init__`:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   self.fc1 = nn.Linear(21, 256)   # 21 input features\n",
    "   self.fc2 = nn.Linear(256, 128)\n",
    "   self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, 64)\n",
    "   self.fc4 = nn.Linear(64, 3)     # 3 output classes\n",
    "   self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Layers are defined ONCE in `__init__`\n",
    "   - Each layer is stored as an attribute (`self.fc1`, etc.)\n",
    "   - Dropout rate 0.3 = 30% of neurons dropped during training\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forward Pass:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def forward(self, x):\n",
    "       x = self.fc1(x)\n",
    "       x = torch.relu(x)\n",

    "       return x\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **ReLU applied AFTER each linear layer** (not before)\n",
    "   - Dropout applied after activation\n",
    "   - **Final layer returns logits (no softmax!)** - CrossEntropyLoss handles it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:**\n",
    "- `__init__` = define layers ONCE\n",
    "- `forward` = apply layers in sequence to data\n",
    "- Final layer outputs **logits** (raw scores), not probabilities\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Data Preparation (Tensors & DataLoaders)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert to Tensors:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(X_train.values)  # Features = FloatTensor\n",
    "   y_train_tensor = torch.LongTensor(y_train.values)   # Labels = LongTensor\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Features MUST be `FloatTensor` (continuous)\n",
    "   - Labels MUST be `LongTensor` (integer class indices)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TensorDataset:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train_tensor, y_train_tensor)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Pairs features with labels\n",
    "   - Enables batching\n",

    "3. **DataLoader:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Automatically creates batches\n",
    "   - `shuffle=True` for train, `False` for val/test\n",
    "   - Batch size 32 chosen as balance between speed and memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why DataLoaders?**\n",
    "- Automatic batching (don't manually slice arrays)\n",
    "- Memory efficient (load data in chunks)\n",
    "- Shuffling for better training\n",

    "   model = TabularFFN(21, 3)  # 21 inputs, 3 outputs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loss Function (CRITICAL FIX!):**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class_weights_tensor = torch.FloatTensor([0.396, 18.26, 2.39])\n",
    "   criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights_tensor)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Initial error:** Used `CrossEntropyLoss()` without weights → model ignored minorities\n",
    "   - **Fix:** Added class weights → model learned all 3 classes!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimizer (MAJOR LEARNING!):**\n",
    "   - **Initial attempt:** `optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)`\n",
    "     - Result: Flat loss curve, no learning\n",
    "   - **Final solution:** `optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.0001, momentum=0.9)`\n",
    "     - Result: Smooth convergence, excellent learning!\n",
    "   - **Key Insight:** SGD with momentum works better for imbalanced tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Loop Structure:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for epoch in range(n_epochs):\n",
    "       model.train()  # Set to training mode (enables dropout)\n",

    "       for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataloader:\n",
    "           optimizer.zero_grad()              # 1. Clear old gradients\n",
    "           predictions = model(x_batch)       # 2. Forward pass\n",
    "           loss = criterion(predictions, y_batch)  # 3. Compute loss\n",
    "           loss.backward()                    # 4. Backward pass (compute gradients)\n",
    "           optimizer.step()                   # 5. Update weights\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The 5-Step Mantra (Memorized!):**\n",
    "1. `zero_grad()` - Clear old gradients\n",
    "2. `model(x)` - Forward pass\n",
    "3. `criterion()` - Compute loss\n",
    "4. `loss.backward()` - Compute gradients\n",
    "5. `optimizer.step()` - Update weights\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Validation Phase:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode (disables dropout)\n",

    "           val_loss = criterion(predictions, y_val)\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "**What Made It Work:**\n",
    "1. Class weights in loss function\n",

    "#### Key Reflections from Notebook 08\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Which errors matter most in diabetes screening?**\n",
    "- **False negatives >> False positives** in cost\n",
    "- Missing diabetes = disease progresses, complications develop\n",
    "- False positive = unnecessary follow-up test (low risk, low cost)\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Prioritize recall over precision\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What threshold would you use in production?**\n",
    "- **NOT the default 0.5 threshold**\n",
    "- Proposed class-specific thresholds:\n",
    "  - Class 1 (Prediabetes): 0.2-0.3 (maximize recall)\n",
    "  - Class 2 (Diabetes): 0.35-0.4 (balance sensitivity/specificity)\n",
    "  - Class 0 (No Diabetes): 0.5+ (maintain specificity)\n",

    "## 🎓 Top 10 Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Class Imbalance is HARD**\n",
    "- Even with class weights, 2% minority class is extremely difficult\n",
    "- PyTorch was the ONLY model to learn Prediabetes (F1: 0.13)\n",
    "- Future: Need SMOTE/ADASYN or focal loss for severe imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Split First, Then Transform**\n",
    "- **Critical order:** Split → Encode → Scale\n",
    "- Fit transformers ONLY on train data to prevent leakage\n",
    "- `OrdinalEncoder.fit(X_train)` then `.transform()` all splits\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Optimizer Choice Matters Massively**\n",
    "- Adam (lr=0.001) → flat loss, no learning\n",
    "- SGD (lr=0.0001, momentum=0.9) → smooth convergence, excellent results\n",
    "- **Lesson:** Different optimizers for different problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Class Weights Are Essential for Imbalanced Data**\n",
    "- Without weights: Model predicts only majority class\n",
    "- With weights: Model learns all classes\n",
    "- Use `compute_class_weight('balanced')` or pass to loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Learning Rate Has Huge Impact**\n",
    "- lr=0.001 → no learning (too high)\n",
    "- lr=0.0001 → excellent convergence\n",
    "- **Rule:** Start small, increase gradually if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Multi-Class Metrics Require Different Parameters**\n",
    "- Binary defaults don't work: `average='binary'` → Error\n",
    "- Must specify: `average='weighted'` or `average='macro'`\n",
    "- ROC-AUC needs: `multi_class='ovr'` for multi-class\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Logits vs. Probabilities vs. Predicted Classes**\n",
    "- `model(x)` → **logits** (raw scores)\n",
    "- `torch.softmax(logits, dim=1)` → **probabilities**\n",
    "- `torch.argmax(logits, dim=1)` → **predicted classes**\n",
    "- CrossEntropyLoss expects logits (applies softmax internally)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Data Shapes Are Debugging Gold**\n",
    "- Always check: `X_train.shape`, `y_proba.shape`, `predictions.shape`\n",
    "- Shape mismatches = first clue to bugs\n",
    "- `(N, 3)` for multi-class probabilities, NOT `(N,)` sliced\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Clinical Context Changes Everything**\n",
    "- Accuracy isn't enough for healthcare\n",
    "- False negatives >> false positives in cost\n",
    "- Threshold tuning is essential for deployment\n",
    "- Domain knowledge guides feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Iterative Debugging is the Real Skill**\n",
    "- Flat loss → check class predictions → add class weights\n",
    "- Multi-class error → check `average` parameter → fix\n",
    "- Shape error → check slicing → remove `[:, 1]`\n",
    "- **Process:** Error → Diagnose → Hypothesize → Fix → Verify\n",

    "## 🔄 Transfer Learning Breakthrough (Project 03 Snapshot)\n",
    "- **Date:** 2025-11-09\n",
    "- **Goal:** Understand why transfer learning (ResNet-18) outperformed the scratch CNN on retinal DR classification.\n",
    "- **What clicked:** Pretrained Imagenet filters already capture retinal textures, so only the classifier head needs to learn severity boundaries. Macro-F1 jumped from 0.31 → 0.65.\n",
    "- **What confused me:** Why severe/proliferative recall was previously zero even with class weights—turns out the scratch CNN never saw enough diverse patterns to generalise.\n",
    "- **One change for next time:** Start with a pretrained backbone sooner, then fine-tune deeper layers once the head converges.\n",
    "- **Next experiment:** Unfreeze the last ResNet block, add retina-specific augmentation (CLAHE, rotations), and test focal loss to tighten `moderate` vs `proliferative` separation.\n"
